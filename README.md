T-Strike is a fast-paced, reaction-based web game where precision is everything. Your goal? Stop the timer exactly at a randomly generated target time (e.g., _5.00 seconds_). Simple? Yes. Easy? Not at all.

Developed using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, this project showcases fundamental frontend development skills and is fully deployed via GitHub Pages.  
It was also originally created as part of a high school computer science project.
